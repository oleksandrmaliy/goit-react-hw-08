        A telephone directory, commonly called a telephone book, telephone
        address book, phonebook, or the white and yellow pages, is a listing of
        telephone subscribers in a geographical area or subscribers to services
        provided by the organization that publishes the directory. Its purpose
        is to allow the telephone number of a subscriber identified by name and
        address to be found. The advent of the Internet, search engines, and
        smartphones in the 21st century greatly reduced the need for a paper
        phone book. Some communities, such as Seattle and San Francisco, sought
        to ban their unsolicited distribution as wasteful, unwanted and harmful
        to the environment. The slogan "Let Your Fingers Do the Walking" refers
        to use of phone books.

        Subscriber names are generally listed in alphabetical order, together
        with their postal or street address and telephone number. In principle
        every subscriber in the geographical coverage area is listed, but
        subscribers may request the exclusion of their number from the
        directory, often for a fee; their number is then said to be "unlisted"
        (US and Canada), "ex-directory" (British English), or "private"
        (Australia and New Zealand). A telephone directory may also provide
        instructions: how to use the telephone service, how to dial a particular
        number, be it local or international, what numbers to access important
        and emergency services, utilities, hospitals, doctors, and organizations
        who can provide support in times of crisis. It may also have civil
        defense, emergency management, or first aid information. There may be
        transit maps, postal code/zip code guides, international dialing codes
        or stadium seating charts, as well as advertising. In the US, under
        current rules and practices, mobile phone and voice over IP listings are
        not included in telephone directories. Efforts to create cellular
        directories have met stiff opposition from several fronts, including
        those who seek to avoid telemarketers.
